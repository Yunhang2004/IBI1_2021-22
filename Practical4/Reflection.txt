I spent quite a long time going through all the instructions for this week's practical.
It's easy to read all through it, but quite a different thing when you start to do it by yourself.
For a novice like me, things can go wrong in many ways, for example copying and saving files to a wrong place.
Also, applying what you learned in the lecture to reality requires you to think flexibly and it takes time to get used to.
I think one of the most important quanlities for learning programming is to have the courage to try new things, and to try again when things go wrong.
Sometimes it also requires a bit of wild imagination to fix an error.
Just combine what you've known, and try it out courageously. Very often the output will be surprising.
